This is the main code from the paper *Slowly Varying Solitary Waves in the Extended Shallow Water Model with a Perturbation Term* published in *Physica Scripta* (DOI: 10.1088/1402-4896/ada215). It is unrefined, with some comments in Chinese. The symbolic calculations use Maple 2023, and numerical computations use MATLAB 2024b. (email 1820210058@qq.com)
